# Architecture

Codex talks to one Bifrost endpoint using the Responses API. The project-owned
Go plugin supplies three policies from one immutable, validated configuration:

1. The pre-auth hook resolves the model. Only an exact `openai` provider with
   `request_passthrough` may activate Bifrost's direct-key path. Every other
   route loses inbound `Authorization`, provider-key, and direct-key headers.
2. The LLM hook selects `native`, `chat_polyfill`, or `unsupported` by declared
   model capability. Polyfill mode asks Bifrost core to translate Responses to
   Chat Completions and translate the result or SSE stream back.
3. The post-transport hook hydrates successful Codex model-list requests while
   preserving unknown upstream fields. Account-aware provider catalogs flow
   through automatically; explicit entries supply overrides and provide a
   fallback for providers without discovery.

The native plugin and host are built with Go 1.27 against Bifrost core v1.9.0.
The Bifrost transport source is pinned in `flake.lock`; the plugin-load check
fails if shared Go package identities drift.

No provider name is hard-coded for compatibility behavior. Provider names are
configuration keys; the sole deliberate exception is the security rule that
request credential passthrough is allowed only for the exact `openai` key.

See [ADR 0001](adr/0001-native-bifrost-plugin.md) for the plugin decision and
[ADR 0002](adr/0002-request-scoped-openai-auth.md) for the authentication flow.
