# Operations

## Deployment

Build the non-root OCI image stream with:

```sh
nix build .#ai-best-model-route-image
```

The image expects declarative configuration at `/etc/bifrost/config.json`,
copies it into its writable runtime directory, and listens on loopback for a
same-pod gateway by default.

Build `.#default` and configure the NixOS module:

```nix
services.ai-best-model-route = {
  enable = true;
  configFile = ./bifrost.json;
  credentials.MANAGED_PROVIDER_API_KEY = "/run/secrets/managed-provider-api-key";
};
```

The service listens on `127.0.0.1:8080` by default. Expose it remotely only
behind an authenticated, TLS-terminating boundary. The module copies the
declarative Bifrost config into its systemd-managed state directory on restart.

## Health and verification

- `GET /health` verifies that the HTTP host is accepting requests.
- `GET /v1/models?client_version=operator-check` exercises Codex hydration.
- A native OpenAI request without Codex auth must return 401.
- A configured non-OpenAI request must work without passing the inbound OpenAI
  bearer to its upstream.

Run `nix flake check -L` before deployment. It includes formatting, schema,
unit, race, ABI-load, auth-isolation, non-streaming, and streaming integration
checks.

## Upgrade and rollback

Upgrade only by changing pinned flake inputs in a reviewed commit. Bifrost
updates must pass the ABI and full e2e checks because even a patch-level core
change can invalidate a Go plugin. Retain the previous flake lock and system
generation; use normal NixOS generation rollback if health or conformance
checks fail.

Codex profile changes are independently reversible with `router profile
uninstall` or `router profile rollback BACKUP`.

## Failure triage

- Plugin load error mentioning a different package version: host/plugin ABI
  mismatch; rebuild both from this flake.
- `unresolved_model`: add the canonical slug or a unique alias to router config.
- `polyfill_*` error: the request uses a feature excluded by the model adapter.
- Provider 401/403 on a non-OpenAI model: verify the Bifrost `env.NAME` reference
  and systemd credential mapping; do not add Codex auth as a workaround.
- Catalog lacks a model: verify that account-aware discovery is enabled and the
  authenticated upstream lists it. For providers without model discovery,
  declare the model explicitly in router config.
